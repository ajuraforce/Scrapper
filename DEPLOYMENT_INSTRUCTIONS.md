## üîß Manual Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Create Repository:**
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New Repository"
   - Name it: `Scrapper`
   - Make it Public or Private as preferred
   - Don't initialize with README (we have our own)

2. **Upload Files:**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop these files:
     - `app.py`
     - `enhanced_scraper_with_credentials.py`
     - `main.py`
     - `README.md`
     - `requirements.txt`
     - `.gitignore`
     - `replit.md`
     - `deploy_to_github.py`

3. **Commit:**
   - Add commit message: "üöÄ Initial deployment of JobRight Scraper"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option 2: Using Git Commands (If Available)

```bash
# Initialize repository
git init

# Add all files
git add app.py enhanced_scraper_with_credentials.py main.py README.md requirements.txt .gitignore replit.md deploy_to_github.py

# Configure git (replace with your info)
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Commit files
git commit -m "üöÄ Initial deployment of JobRight Scraper"

# Add remote (your repository)
git remote add origin https://github.com/ajuraforce/Scrapper.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Using the Deployment Script (Future)

Once uploaded to GitHub and cloned locally with git access:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export GITHUB_PAT="your_personal_access_token"
export GITHUB_OWNER="ajuraforce"
export GITHUB_REPO="Scrapper"

# Run deployment script
python3 deploy_to_github.py
```

## üîê Important Notes

### Files to EXCLUDE from GitHub:
- `credentials.json` - Contains sensitive Google Service Account keys
- `.last_account` - Account rotation tracking file
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache files
- `attached_assets/` - Temporary files

### Files INCLUDED in Repository:
- All application code
- Documentation
- Configuration files
- Deployment scripts

## üåê Repository URL
Your repository will be available at:
**https://github.com/ajuraforce/Scrapper**

## üìã Post-Deployment Steps

   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add secrets for automated deployment if needed

4. **Set Up Deployment:**

   - Set environment variables as needed

## ‚úÖ Verification

After deployment, verify these files are present in your GitHub repository:

- [x] app.py (main application)
- [x] enhanced_scraper_with_credentials.py (scraper logic)
- [x] requirements.txt (dependencies)
- [x] .gitignore (security exclusions)
